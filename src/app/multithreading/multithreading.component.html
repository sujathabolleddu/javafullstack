Os contains processes
<hr>
Process contains Threads
Each process can have only one thread running at a time

Lifecycle of a Thread
NEW, RUNNABLE, WAIT, BLOCKED, TERMINATED
New, Runnable, Running(Non existent), Non Runnable(Block), Terminated
Create a Thread Instance, Start a thread, Picked yp by thread schedular and running, (wait, sleep etc), once run method is executed

Creation of Threads
Thread can be created in two types
Extend Thread class – M extends Thread have one run method , in main method M a = new M(), a.start()
Implement Runnable Interface
M class implements Runnable, have one run method
M a = new M()
Thread b = new Thread(a), b.start()
Thread Scheduler

Part of JVM that decides which thread should run
Preemptive scheduling – higher priority task runs until it eneters wait
Time slicing Scheduling – predefined slice of time and gets back to ready, then next thread starts based on prio

Thread Pooling

If we create many threads , OS may run out of system level threads
Or each thread gets very less time for execution
Thread Pool Pattern helps to save resources in multithreaded app
We write concurrent code in form of parallel tasks and submit execution it to the instance of thread pool
Instance controls the threads to execute these tasks
Task Submitters – create and submit tasks
Executor service – contains Task Queue and Thread pool, returns a future object for fine tuning the result
Can take a runnable or callable object as input thread for execution

Executors, when the fine tuning of result is not required

    Hello!
</div>

<div>
    Thread is defined at operating system level. It is a set of instructions.An application is composed of several threads.
    Different threads can be executed at the same time.

    Hello
</div>
<div>
    Same Time in single core CPU - Time sliced between multiple threads
    On Multicore, things are happening at same time
</div>
<ul>
   <h6> Who is responsible for CPU sharing? - Special element called thread scheduler
    Scheduler pauses a thread for three reasons</h6>
    <li>Resource equal sharing- priority</li>
    <li>Thread is Waiting for data</li>
    <li>Thread is waiting for another thread to do something(release a resource)</li>
</ul>
<div><h6>Race Condition</h6></div>
<div>
    Accessing data concurrently may lead to issues, two threads reading same variable, field, array.
</div>
<div>Two threads trying to read and write at same time</div>
<div>Synchronized prevents the thread schedular to give a hand to another thread when a block is being executed by one thread</div>
<div>Java machine uses a special object called a lock object that has a key to run the synchronized block</div>
<div> Thread makes a request to lock object to give the key to enter synchronized block, it gives if available</div>
<div>Every Java object can play the role of a lock object, key is defined internally in the object class</div>
<div>Key is also called monitor</div>
<div>A synchronized static method uses the class as a synchronization object(lock object)</div>
<div>A synchronized non-static method uses the instance as a synchronization object</div>
<div>We can use explicit object created to use for synchronization and synchronize block of code instead of method</div>
<div> synchronized on method - implicit lock (class, instance), on block </div>
<div>Reentrant locks - Locks are reentrant when a thread holds a lock , it can enter a clock synchronized on the lock it is holding</div>
<div><h6>Deadlock</h6></div>
<div>Deadlock is a situation where T1 holds a key required by T2 and T2 holds a key required by T1 and both wait for eachother to release</div>
<div><h6>Runnable</h6></div>
<div>Create an instance or Runnable</div>
<div>Pass it to constructor of thread class</div>
<div> call the start method on thread object</div>
</div>
